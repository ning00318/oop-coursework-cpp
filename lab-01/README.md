# Lab 01: 2D Array Operations

## Description
In this project, I practiced how to write functions to calculate data for 2D arrays. The program processes a 4x5 matrix with test data.

## Features
- Created functions to find the sum and average of all values.
- Implemented functions to calculate the sum of specific rows and columns.
- Developed functions to find the highest and lowest numbers within a specific row.

## What I Learned
- Using nested for loops to read data from the array.
- Using `static_cast<double>` to get correct decimal results for averages.

## Sample Output
```text
The total of the array elements is 210
The average value of an element is 10.5
The total of row 0 is 15
The total of col 2 is 42
The highest value in row 2 is 15
The lowest value in row 2 is 11
```
